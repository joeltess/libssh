%description
The ssh library was designed to be used by programmers needing a working 
SSH implementation by the mean of a library. The complete control of the 
client is made by the programmer. With libssh, you can remotely execute 
programs, transfer files, use a secure and transparent tunnel for your 
remote programs. With its Secure FTP implementation, you can play with 
remote files easily, without third-party programs others than libcrypto 
(from openssl). libssh features :

    * Full C library functions for manipulating a client-side SSH
      connection
    * Lesser GPL licensing -SSH2 protocol compliant
    * Fully configurable sessions
    * Support for AES-128,AES-192,AES-256,blowfish, in cbc mode
    * Use multiple SSH connections in a same process, at same time
    * Use multiple channels in the same connection
    * Thread safety when using different sessions at same time
    * Basic but correct SFTP implementation (secure file transfer)
    * RSA and DSS server public key supported
    * Compression support (with zlib)
    * Public key (RSA and DSS), password and keyboard-interactive
      authentication
    * Complete documentation about its API
    * Runs and tested under amd64, x86, arm, sparc32, ppc under Linux,
      BSD, MacosX and Solaris
    * A developer listening to you
    * It's free (LGPL)!
